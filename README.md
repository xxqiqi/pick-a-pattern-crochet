# pick-a-pattern-crochet
Use this randomizer to find your next favorite crochet pattern!

Hey everyone. 

I'm a beginner when it comes to crocheting. I've got the basic crochet stitches down already but am always looking to learn something new. I hope that this randomizer helps you find a new pattern idea for your next scarf or blanket and learn a new technique.

Please feel free to add more more stiches to the crochet bank file. The main code will draw from this bank to randomize a result.

Thanks!

Happy crocheting and programming. :3
